# ⚡ NEURO4D
A cutting-edge neural network simulation built from the ground up in Go, modeling neurons in x dimension space with dynamic signal propagation, learning, and adaptive behavior. This project simulates complex neural interactions, leveraging real-time backpropagation and a novel family tree-based feedback mechanism.

## Features
* 🌐 Multi Dimensional Neural Architecture: Simulates neurons positioned in x dimension space.
* 🔄 Dynamic Signal Propagation: Signals weaken over distance, encouraging efficiency.
* 🎯 Custom Backpropagation: Capped backpropagation ensures learning speed and allows for lower end hardware to run the model.
* 💡 Adaptive Learning: Positive rewards promote optimal paths from input to output.

This project is mainly to learn but also to explore this new way of building ai models.
